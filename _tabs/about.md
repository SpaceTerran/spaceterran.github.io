Hello folks!

I'm Isaac, an old hand at IT infrastructure, always on the hunt for new tech adventures. My 20+ years of industry experience have taken me from an IT newbie to leading dynamic teams across the globe. I've run the gamut, setting up infrastructures in diverse locations, managing substantial budgets, and even serving on a bunch of serious-sounding committees.

These days, I'm all about breaking IT down for the everyday user. Think of me as your personal decoder for all things tech-related.

When I'm not knee-deep in my day-to-day activities as an IT Director for a Fortune 500 company, I retreat to my home-lab, where I endeavor to translate the complex into simple, user-friendly terms. It's what I love, and I can't wait to share it all with you.

Looking for a bit of decoding in the world of IT infrastructure? Then you're in the right place. Let's enjoy this journey together, and feel free to give me a shout, anytime!

Cheers,
Isaac
