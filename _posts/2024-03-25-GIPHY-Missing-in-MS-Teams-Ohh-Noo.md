Before we dive in, it’s worth taking a moment to look at [Overview of optional connected experiences in Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/privacy/teams-privacy-oce-overview) for any privacy or security concerns you may have.

Alright, with that important note out of the way, let’s get into it. I was really feeling a case of the "Mondays" today, and wanted to share a good morning GIF with my team. Lo and behold, GIPHY was suddenly missing!!

Clearly this was making me very unhappy 🤣

Here’s the steps I took to bring back the missing GIPHY in Microsoft Teams.

  >Head over to the ellipsis (that’s the '...' for the uninitiated) next to your company name, select 'Settings,'.

  >Then, you guessed it, 'Privacy.' You’ll want to make sure "Optional Connected Experiences" is turned 'Enabled.' Spoiler alert: mine was not.

  >Here’s the head-scratcher – even though my team oversees these settings and we hadn’t fiddled with anything recently, something seemed to have shifted on Microsoft's side. Just last week, everything was ticking along nicely.
  {: .prompt-tip }

  >Next, it’s time to sign out and give Teams a bit of a breather. Here’s the play-by-play:

>- Click your lovely profile picture and press 'Sign Out.' 
- Give it a sec—patience is a virtue—and you'll see the sign-on screen.
- Then, do a little right-click magic on the Teams icon in the task bar and choose 'Quit.'
{: .prompt-warning }

  >Fire up MS Teams again, and voilà, GIPHY should be back in action. Crisis averted, I know—you can thank me later.
