Before we dive in, itâ€™s worth taking a moment to look at [Overview of optional connected experiences in Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/privacy/teams-privacy-oce-overview) for any privacy or security concerns you may have.

Alright, with that important note out of the way, letâ€™s get into it. I was really feeling a case of the "Mondays" today, and wanted to share a good morning GIF with my team. Lo and behold, GIPHY was suddenly missing!!

Clearly this was making me very unhappy ðŸ¤£

Hereâ€™s the steps I took to bring back the missing GIPHY in Microsoft Teams.

  >Head over to the ellipsis (thatâ€™s the '...' for the uninitiated) next to your company name, select 'Settings,'.

  >Then, you guessed it, 'Privacy.' Youâ€™ll want to make sure "Optional Connected Experiences" is turned 'Enabled.' Spoiler alert: mine was not.

  >Hereâ€™s the head-scratcher â€“ even though my team oversees these settings and we hadnâ€™t fiddled with anything recently, something seemed to have shifted on Microsoft's side. Just last week, everything was ticking along nicely.

  >Next, itâ€™s time to sign out and give Teams a bit of a breather. Hereâ€™s the play-by-play:

>- Click your lovely profile picture and press 'Sign Out.' 
- Give it a secâ€”patience is a virtueâ€”and you'll see the sign-on screen.
- Then, do a little right-click magic on the Teams icon in the task bar and choose 'Quit.'

  >Fire up MS Teams again, and voilÃ , GIPHY should be back in action. Crisis averted, I knowâ€”you can thank me later.
