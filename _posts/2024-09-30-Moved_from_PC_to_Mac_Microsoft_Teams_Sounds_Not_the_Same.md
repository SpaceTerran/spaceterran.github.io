Have you recently moved from a PC to a Mac and noticed that when using MS Teams, things are just a bit different? Well, some of this can be expected, of course. However, one thing that was driving me crazy was that the notification sounds, calling sounds, etc., were all completely different. Yes, this didn't impact anything functionally, but for some reason, the familiar sounds of Microsoft Teams being missing just ‚Äî well, I couldn't live without them. Thanks, Microsoft brainwashing!

## How to Fix It

1. Open your MS Teams settings by clicking on the three dots in the upper right-hand corner.
2. Select **Settings**.
