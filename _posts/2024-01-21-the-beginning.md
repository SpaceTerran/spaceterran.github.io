# Welcome!

Hello there! Glad to see you on my space of the interwebs.

## About Me

With over two decades of experience in the IT industry, I specialize in conveying complex technical concepts in layman terms. I am passionate about simplifying IT infrastructure complexities and interpreting them into digestible content.

If you're as curious and fired up about network and infrastructure, server environments, or happen to be an enthusiast who enjoys building home setups, you're in the right place. Get ready for an insightful adventure!

## Future State

In the near future, I plan to kick-start my YouTube channel. This platform will predominantly be an extension of my work, where I will share the processes and motivations behind my scripts. In addition, I'll be discussing lessons learned, sharing insights on current IT news topics, and much more. The content is currently under development, so please check back soon for updates!
