# Another One BytesðŸ™ƒ the Dust - Google Podcasts to Say its Final Goodbye

I woke up to a rather interesting email today. Making its way into my inbox was a message from Google Podcasts announcing that it's signing off for good in 2024. Yes, folks, you heard it right - one of our favorite podcast platforms is bidding adieu this year. P.S. This could be old news to some, but I missed this until nowðŸ˜‚

According to the email, Google is offering a transitional process, allowing its users to migrate show subscriptions to YouTube Music. For those who may not be interested in syncing their shows with YouTube, Google also provides an option to download a file of your show subscriptions that you can import to any app supporting such import.

The email states that after March 2024, users, at least in the U.S., will no longer be able to listen to podcasts on Google Podcasts, and by June 2024, the option to migrate or export your subscriptions will disappear too.

As a seasoned Google Podcast user, even post my switch to an iPhone, this news brings a feeling of melancholy. It's no secret that Google Podcasts held its own charm, a unique user interface and a vast array of features that held steadfast on my daily driver. As for syncing it with YouTube Music, I find myself in a fix. Maybe it's the appeal of Spotify's well-funded platform that's calling out to me. Is the grass really greener on the other side? I guess it's time to find out??

This brings me to an interesting point of discussion with all of you. In the light of this drastic change, what platforms are you planning to jump ship to? Would you stick with Google's eco-system and shift to YouTube Music or would you rather explore new vistas like Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or others? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.
